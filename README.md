# Reverse Polish Notation Parser

_Just an another bored man..._


If you have no idea what's **Reverse Polish Notation**, you can check it on [wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjH45v8x67YAhXJ4IMKHS_4B_cQFggvMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReverse_Polish_notation&usg=AOvVaw2mN4WrOI1Sk0mYPBG9JB3U).

If you want to try to compile the source yourself, be sure to check out [Jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison).
The `rpn-grammar.jison` file is what you will use to compile with jison which will output an another js file which you will use to start parsing inputs.
